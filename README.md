# Tetris + AI
Welcome to the Tetris + AI project! This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to play Tetris autonomously. The project leverages deep reinforcement learning techniques to train an AI agent capable of mastering the game.


## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project's directory. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train the model

You can train the model either with or without a graphical user interface (GUI):
Without GUI: Run the following command to train the model in a non-visual environment:

```sh
python train.py
```

With GUI: Use this command to train the model with a visual representation of the game:

```sh
python train_gui.py
```

## Test the model

To test the trained model with a GUI, execute the following command:

```sh
python test_gui.py
```
